In this exercise we will create a game similar to the famous [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) video game.

Implement the following items (25 points):
1. Draw the player in a different shape than the asteroids.
1. Let the player also move up and down.
1. Change the collision response between an asteroid and the player to destroy or damage the player on touch.
1. Create more asteroids that behave like the first.
1. Wrap around screen edges:
   1. When the player moves outside the window [s]he should reenter on the opposite side.
   1. When an asteroid moves outside the window it should reenter on the opposite side and continue on its original direction.
1. The Player can shoot.
1. Shot cool down - you can only shoot at regular intervals.
1. A shot that hits an asteroid breaks it into two smaller asteroids, which move away from each other.
1. Each asteroid that collides (with player or other asteroid) should break up into two smaller asteroids that move away from each other.
1. There should be a smallest asteroid size.
1. A shot that hits a smallest asteroid removes this asteroid.
1. Asteroids should rotate with individual speeds.
1. After all asteroids are destroyed a new level is started with more asteroids.
1. Add other elements of [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) like a score system, UFOs, "thrust movement", ... or your own ideas. (up to 5 points)
